\brief Smoketest puzzle module

This puzzle module was used as a substitute for the \ref puz_neo
"NeoTrellis puzzle module" during the 23-24 assessment due to the I2C issues
encountered with the Adafruit NeoTrellis modules.

This puzzle module turns on an on-board LED when it is in the \ref
PB_GS_PLAYING "playing" state, and sets itself to the \ref PB_GS_SOLVED
"solved" state when an external button is pressed.
