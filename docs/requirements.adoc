== Introduction

In this document, the specifications are described prior to the investigation
of the Puzzle Box project. These specifications are partly derived from the
previously established requirements and are further supplemented and modified.
The priority of specifications is indicated using the MoSCoW method, see

This specification document covers hardware, software, and game-specific
details. The focus in this project year for the Puzzle Box is to thoroughly
document the system and create a software framework for future groups.

== Context

This chapter describes how the user will interact with the system. This is done
in the form of a user story. This user story covers hardware, software, and
game specifications. From this narrative, many specifications can be derived
for both functional and non-functional requirements
(<<sec:functional>> and <<sec:technical>>).

The game administrator picks up the puzzle box and places it on a flat surface.
By using the key switch, the puzzle box is turned on, and the green indicator
LED lights up. Through the mesh network established by the external puzzle box
hub, the corresponding web panel can be accessed. The web panel provides
instructions for configuring the puzzle box, including linking it to any bomb.
The instructions issue a warning if any of the start conditions are not
properly set. If a criterion is incorrectly configured, it is highlighted for
resolution. Additionally, a warning is given if the battery capacity is
insufficient for one game duration, causing the indicator LED on the puzzle box
to turn red. In such cases, the battery should be charged using the USB-C
cable. While the puzzle box is charging, the indicator LED is blue. Once there
are no warnings and the puzzle box is adequately charged, the game can be
started in the web panel.

The puzzle box begins with the NeoTrellis game. In this game, players must turn
off all LEDs on an 8x8 button LED matrix. When any button is pressed, the
directly adjacent LEDs toggle. If a lit LED is toggled, it turns off; if an
unlit LED is toggled, it turns on. Once all LEDs are turned off, the game is
solved, and the software puzzle begins.

On the software puzzle, there are 6 banana plug connectors on both the left and
right sides. The ones on the left are labeled with various logical gates, while
the ones on the right are labeled from A to F. Participants in the bomb game
have 6 pieces of C-code written on paper, corresponding to the logical gates on
the puzzle box. The bomb participants must provide a description of the C-code
to the puzzle box participants, allowing them to correctly connect the
appropriate logical gate to the corresponding letter. Once the correct
combination of logical gates with the correct letter is made, the game is
solved. Subsequently, the automation puzzle is initiated.

Since there is no concept available for the automation puzzle yet, the hardware
puzzle is started directly.

The hardware puzzle is played in two distinct phases. In Phase 1, the objective
is to solve a combinatorial circuit such that its output becomes '1'. There are
8 inputs for this circuit, each controlled by an on/off switch. Once the
combinatorial circuit evaluates to '1', the LED at the output lights up,
indicating the completion of the first phase. In Phase 2, another LED blinks,
consistently repeating a pattern. This pattern represents a randomly generated
Morse code, corresponding to a number from 0 to 9999. Participants use a Morse
code table to decipher the correct number. Using four potentiometers, the
participants can set a number on a 7-segment display. When this number matches
the randomly generated one, the hardware puzzle is solved. Subsequently, the
vault puzzle is initiated.

In the vault puzzle, a 7-segment display shows a random combination of a letter
and a digit. Participants have access to a list containing the correct button
combination for the corresponding letter and digit. The vault puzzle consists
of 5 levels, each displaying a unique button combination from the list. When
participants correctly press the button on the keypad, the level advances, and
a new value is shown. Pressing the wrong button restarts the game at level 1.
Once all 5 levels are completed, the vault door unlocks, allowing access to the
inside of the puzzle box. On the mainboard, there is a 7-segment display
showing a code. This code must be relayed to the participants of the bomb game.
Once the bomb team receives the code, the puzzle box is considered solved.

[[sec:functional]]
== Functional Requirements

The functional requirements describe the things which are important to the
client. This is mainly about the way the product is going to be used, what it
is going to look like, and how the product reacts to interaction. This chapter
describes all functional requirements of the puzzle box.
