:document: Handover Report
include::share/meta.adoc[]

== Introduction

This is an (at times slightly informal) document that summarizes how the 23-24
run of this project went. We found the previous handover documents to be
unhelpful when determining the 'actual' state of the project in the first few
weeks, and felt they did not address the pitfalls of this project.

The team of year 2023-2024 consisted of only software students (see
<<tab:proj-comp>>), meaning no hardware was developed in this year. The goal of
this year is to create a software framework which can be used to implement new
puzzles and to make the development process of these puzzles easier, and allow
the entire software stack to be ported to the the hardware designed by the
22-23 group.

Previous years' groups have put their predecessor's documents inside their own
project folder, which has resulted in what we called the 'Russian doll folder
structure'. <<pn:blansch>> has separated out each year's project folder
('master file'), and is hosting these on
<https://media.pipeframe.xyz/puzzlebox>. This directory is also mountable as a
read-only WebDAV share on Windows, MacOS and Linux (using davfs2), and does not
require credentials to log in. Please note that this is very much unofficial,
and is not managed or endorsed by Avans. <<pn:blansch>> is the contact for
removal or transfer of these files.

in the project plan, but is no longer mentioned in the handover report, which
may indicate that they were removed from the project group. I am unsure if they
were a hardware student that worked on the PCBs or a CMD student working on the

== Project state

The current project state is as follows:

* No new hardware has been designed or developed this year
* The software was completely revised, now consisting of
** a puzzle bus driver (``pbdrv``)
** a main controller
** a simple CLI application
** two puzzle modules ('Vault' and 'NeoTrellis') integrated using the puzzle
	 bus driver

* The main controller (a RPI Pico W) can interact with the different puzzle
	modules using a central shared I^2^C bus (referred to as the 'puzzle bus')
* The main controller is able to find new puzzle modules on startup, and does
	not check for new modules afterwards.
* A simple CLI application has been developed, which can communicate with the
	main controller through a TCP connection and allows control over various
	aspects of the puzzle box using simple commands.

== Incidents

During this year's run of the project, we encountered several difficuties we
feel need to be addressed in order to be mitigated in future runs of the
project. We recommend that these incidents are analyzed by future project
groups and incorporated into the risk analysis section of future project plan
documents.

=== Documentation

We spent too much time working on documentation at the start of the project.
Make sure you set clear deadlines for documentation, and try not to spend too
much time on review procedures, as these cost a lot of time.

Our project documentation was originally written in Microsoft Word, but we
later transferred all documentation to AsciiDoc because of issues where
OneDrive would roll back changes. If possible, use a documentation system or
format that allows using an external version control system like Git to avoid
losing content.

=== Misconceptions

Make sure to know what you are developing and do some research beforehand, to
make sure you have a complete picture about what you are using. Sounds stupid,
but it happened for multiple project attempts, and caused time loss. This also
includes when you want to use documentation of previous years: go through the
documentation and verify it on the lowest possible level for the same reason as
previously mentioned.  

=== I^2^C

I^2^C is used because it is widely available and easy to implement. We strongly
recommend 3rd year software students to refresh their knowledge on I^2^C before
making major design decisions that rely on their conception of how to I^2^C bus
works.

Please note the following differences between I^2^C devices:

- Regular I^2^C slave peripherals are allowed on the puzzle bus, and can be
	connected to the puzzle bus as long as they do not cause issues with
	addressing.
- I^2^C master controllers must have hardware support for a multi-master
	hardware configuration (i.e. support bus arbitration on a hardware level).
	Arbitration support is required to prevent message corruption or electrical
	shorts in a multi-master setup. Multi-master controllers may also be
	connected to the puzzle bus, but only as long as they only interact with
	regular I^2^C slave devices.
- I^2^C multi-master controllers that are slave-addressable in master mode are
	the only kind of I^2^C controller suitable for use in puzzle modules.

The RP2040 supports multi-master, but is not addressable as a slave in master
mode. Due to time constraints, this was mitigated using a workaround (see
<<fixme:rp2040-i2c>>).

=== Development hardware availability

When choosing or using specific chips or development boards, make sure to
include research on the product lifecycle. Choosing boards/chips that have
planned long term support makes it easier for the next project team to order
and use the same chips/boards instead of having to find new ones.

Due to a lack of foresight, only 2 Picos were ordered this year, which caused
unoptimal workload spread during the last weeks of the project. Because of
this, we also strongly recommend making enough development boards available for
multiple people to develop using the same setup. Note that the RPI Pico is a
special case, as it requires another Pico for debugging, effectively requiring
double the amount of hardware to support developers.

=== Auxiliary workarounds and technical limitations

This section details workarounds that were implemented instead of being fixed
due to time constraints or project scope. Workarounds that should be removed
are marked with ``FIXME:`` comments referring to one of the workarounds
mentioned in this section.

[[fixme:rp2040-i2c,RP2040 I^2^C limitations]]
<<fixme:rp2040-i2c>>::
- All puzzle module drivers have a hard-coded 2 second delay between receiving
	the MAGIC handshake request and the MAGIC handshake response handler. This
	was done to ensure responses are not ignored by the RP2040 (main controller)
	while it is still in I^2^C master mode.

Memory management on Arduino::
The Arduino's built-in memory management functions do not seem to work
properly. The FreeRTOS heap 4 memory management functions are used on the
puzzle modules instead. FreeRTOS does not have an implementation of the
``realloc()`` function.
- mpack's writer API cannot be used with a writer initialized using the
	``mpack_writer_init_growable`` function on Arduino-based puzzle modules. The
	``mpack_writer_init`` function is used with a static size buffer instead.

== Recommendations

This section details our recommendations on course of action for future project
groups.

=== Imperatives

The following points must not be dismissed by future project groups, as they
are critical for project success:

- The 22-23 design document already mentions that the application of the I^2^C
	bus is in a multi-master configuration, but does not mention that this only
	works when pull-up resistors are used on the SCL and SDA lines. The pull-up
	resistors are required, as omitting them makes the bus arbitration process
	very inconsistent which causes frames to be dropped entirely.
- Start creating prototypes as early as possible; this benefits the project in
	the long run, as you have already shown that certain parts of the project are
	already working and "only" need to be integrated.
- The Atmega328P and ATmega2560 MCUs are both sufficient for the puzzle modules
	as they have enough I/O, mutli-master hardware support, and the ability to be
	addressed as a slave while being in master mode.
- The RPI Pico (and Pico W)'s I^2^C peripheral supports multi-master, but does
	not support being addressed as a slave while in master mode. This is required
	for puzzle bus integration, and was mitigated using a workaround (see
	<<fixme:rp2040-i2c>>). A replacement controller should be used instead.

=== Other suggestions

These points are suggestions for future project groups. While we do not think
these are critical to project success, we still think they are important to
mention.

- Implement the hardware design from the year 22-23.
- The original game rules are described in a separate document from the year
	20-21.
- The RPI Pico W has programmable I/O modules. Due to time constraints, we did
	not research if these modules can be used to create a custom I^2^C peripheral
	(and driver) that allows multi-master communication while still being
	addressable as a slave. If this is possible, the RPI Pico W can still be used
	as main controller without the use of workarounds.
