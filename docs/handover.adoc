:document: Handover Report
include::share/meta.adoc[]

== Introduction

This is an informal document that summarizes how the 23-24 run of this project
went. We found the previous handover documents to be unhelpful when determining
the 'actual' state of the project in the first few weeks, and felt they did not
address the pitfalls of this project.

handover report from 20-21 mentions: _"Het frame zelf is niet gelukt om te
realiseren, omdat er communicatie tussen het projectgroep en de CMD-student uit
het niets is verdwenen"_. <<pn:creemers>> was introduced as a hardware-student
in the project plan, but is no longer mentioned in the handover report, which
may indicate that they were removed from the project group. I am unsure if they
were a hardware student that worked on the PCBs or a CMD student working on the
puzzle box chassis.]

== Resources

Previous years' groups have put their predecessor's documents inside their own
project folder, which has resulted in what we called the 'Russian doll folder
structure'. <<pn:blansch>> has separated out each year's project folder
('master file'), and is hosting these on
<https://media.pipeframe.xyz/puzzlebox>. This directory is also mountable as a
read-only WebDAV share on Windows, MacOS and Linux (using davfs2), and does not
require credentials to log in. Please note that this is very much unofficial,
and is not managed or endorsed by Avans. <<pn:blansch>> is the contact for
removal or transfer of these files.

== Recommendations

- The 22-23 design document already mentions that the application of the I^2^C
	bus is in a multi-master configuration, but does not mention that this only
	works when pull-up resistors are used on the SCL and SDA lines. The pull-up
	resistors are required, as omitting them makes the bus arbitration process
	very inconsistent which causes frames to be dropped entirely.
