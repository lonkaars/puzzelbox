== A Note Before Reading
The team of year 2023-2024 consisted of only software students, meaning no 
hardware was developed in this year. We were tasked with simplifying the 
software to the point where it would only have to be ported into the new hardware,
which was designed in the year 2022-2023. The goal of this year is to create
a software framework which can be used to implement new puzzles and to make the 
development process of these puzzles easier. 

Previous years' groups have put their predecessor's documents inside their own
project folder, which has resulted in what we called the 'Russian doll folder
structure'. <<pn:blansch>> has separated out each year's project folder
('master file'), and is hosting these on
<https://media.pipeframe.xyz/puzzlebox>. This directory is also mountable as a
read-only WebDAV share on Windows, MacOS and Linux (using davfs2), and does not
require credentials to log in. Please note that this is very much unofficial,
and is not managed or endorsed by Avans. <<pn:blansch>> is the contact for
removal or transfer of these files.

== Introduction

This is an informal document that summarizes how the 23-24 run of this project
went. We found the previous handover documents to be unhelpful when determining
the 'actual' state of the project in the first few weeks, and felt they did not
address the pitfalls of this project.

het niets is verdwenen"_. <<pn:creemers>> was introduced as a hardware-student
in the project plan, but is no longer mentioned in the handover report, which
may indicate that they were removed from the project group. I am unsure if they
were a hardware student that worked on the PCBs or a CMD student working on the
puzzle box chassis.]

== Project State
The current project state is as follows: No new hardware has been designed 
or developed this year. The software was completely revised, now consisting of a 
a puzzle bus driver, a main controller, a simple CLI application, and two puzzle 
modules. Namely the puzzle modules 'Vault' and 'Neotrellis', both using an Arduino 
as the controller. The main controller (a RPI Pico W) can interact with the 
different puzzle modules using an I^2^C bus. The I^2^C bus has been configured to 
be a multi-master I^2^C bus, allowing the puzzle modules and the main controller 
to initiate a I^2^C transmission. The main controller is able to find 
new puzzle modules on startup, and does not check for new modules afterwards. A 
simple CLI application has been developed, which can communicate with the main 
controller through a TCP connection and simple commands. 

In short: A puzzle bus driver has been implemented to allow for communication 
between the main controller and the puzzle modules. A CLI application was developed 
which connects with the main controller to monitor/edit the game state. And the 
software for the puzzle modules 'Vault' and 'Neotrellis' is in the prototype state.

== Incidents

During this year's run of the project, we encountered several difficuties we
feel need to be addressed. We recommend that these incidents are analyzed by
future project groups and incorporated into the risk analysis section of future
project plan documents.

=== Misconceptions

Make sure to know what you are developing and do some research beforehand, to make 
sure you have the complete picture about what you are using. Sounds stupid, but it 
happened for multiple project attempts, and caused time loss. This also includes 
when you want to use documentation of previous years: go through the documentation 
and verify it on the lowest possible level for the same reason as previously 
mentioned.  

=== I^2^C

I^2^C is easy to implement but also easy to underestimate, this project requires a 
multi-master structure as communication is otherwise too complicated compared to 
other means of communication.

For I^2^C on hardware level: make sure to use pull-up resistors as it is otherwise 
impossible to use I^2^C due to incorrect messages. This is also required for 
controllers which are connected to the I^2^C bus. Make sure to use I^2^C devices 
that support arbitration when using it as a multi-master. 

The RPI Pico W (RP2040) does supports multi-master to the point of being able to 
receive messages from other multi-masters as a slave while being configured as master. 
Everything else about the I^2^C bus works, but due to this limitation a workaround has 
been implemented to be able to continue using the RPI Pico W. 
To simplify; a controller is needed which supports multi-master 
while being able to be addressed as a slave.

=== Development hardware availability

When choosing or using specific chips or development boards, make sure to
include research on the product lifecycle. Choosing boards/chips that have
planned long term support makes it easier for the next project team to order
and use the same chips/boards instead of having to find new ones.

This also includes having enough development boards for multiple people to
program using the same setup, e.g. the RPI Pico W requires another RPI Pico W
to be debugged, effectively requiring the project team to have at least 4 RPI
Pico Ws to be able to develop in the same environment (if there are 2 software
students).

=== Auxiliary workarounds and technical limitations

This section details unelegant workarounds that should be removed from the
code. Workarounds that should be removed are marked with ``FIXME:`` comments
referring to one of the workarounds mentioned in this section.

RP2040 I^2^C limitations::
- All puzzle module drivers have a hard-coded 2 second delay between receiving
	the MAGIC handshake request and the MAGIC handshake response handler. This
	was done to ensure responses are not ignored by the RP2040 (main controller)
	while it is still in I^2^C master mode.

Memory management on Arduino::
The Arduino's built-in memory management functions do not seem to work
properly. The FreeRTOS heap 4 memory management functions are used on the
puzzle modules instead. FreeRTOS does not have an implementation of the
``realloc()`` function.
- mpack's writer API cannot be used with a writer initialized using the
	``mpack_writer_init_growable`` function on Arduino-based puzzle modules. The
	``mpack_writer_init`` function is used with a static size buffer instead.

== Recommendations

=== Imperatives
* The 22-23 design document already mentions that the application of the I^2^C
bus is in a multi-master configuration, but does not mention that this only
works when pull-up resistors are used on the SCL and SDA lines. The pull-up
resistors are required, as omitting them makes the bus arbitration process
very inconsistent which causes frames to be dropped entirely.
* Start creating prototypes as fast as possible; this benefits the project in the long run, 
as you have already shown that certain parts of the project are already working and "only" 
need to be integrated.
* The Atmega328P chip is sufficient for the puzzle modules as it has enough I/O, mutli-master
hardware support, and the ability to be addressed as a slave while being in master mode. 
* The hardware design can be taken from the year 22-23, and the game rules are taken from 
the year 20-21.

// TODO: rename this bitch
=== Loose imperatives 
* The RPI Pico W has programmable IO modules, making it possible to create an I^2^C driver 
that allows multi-master communication while still being addressable as a slave.
